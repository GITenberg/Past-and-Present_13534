description: "Past and Present is a book by Thomas Carlyle. It was published in April\
  \ 1843 in England and the following month in the United States. It combines medieval\
  \ history with criticism of 19th-century British society. Carlyle wrote it in seven\
  \ weeks as a respite from the harassing labor of writing Cromwell. He was inspired\
  \ by the recently published Chronicles of the Abbey of Saint Edmund's Bury, which\
  \ had been written by Jocelin of Brakelond at the close of the 12th century. This\
  \ account of a medieval monastery had taken Carlyle's fancy, and he drew upon it\
  \ in order to contrast the monks' reverence for work and heroism with the sham leadership\
  \ of his own day.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
